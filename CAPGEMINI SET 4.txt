Here is pseudo code for ___________ algorithm.

Set n to number of records to be sorted
repeat
flag = false;
for counter = 1 to n-1 do
if key[counter] > key[counter+1] then
swap the records;
set flag = true;
end if
end do
n = n-1;
until flag = false or n=1

Here is  pseudo code for ___________ algorithm.

If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
    Print "passed"
else
    Print "failed"  
endif
----------------------------------------------------------
Here is  pseudo code for ___________ algorithm.

Set total to zero
Set grade counter to one
While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
    Input the next grade
    Add the grade into the total
endwhile 
Set the class average to the total divided by ten
Print the class average.
--------------------------------------------------------
Here is  pseudo code for ___________ algorithm.

Initialize total to zero
Initialize counter to zero
Input the first grade
while the user has not as yet entered the sentinel
   add this grade into the running total 
   add one to the grade counter  
   input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)
endwhile

if the counter is not equal to zero
   set the average to the total divided by the counter
   print the average  
else
   print 'no grades were entered' 
endif

Here is  pseudo code for ___________ algorithm.

Algorithm start
Declare an array of string type variable called word
Declare a loopcounter
Store a string in the array word
for loopcounter = (length of the word) – 1 to 0
loopcounter = loopcounter – 1
print arrayword[loopcounter]
endfor
