1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the day, month, and year.

The month can be a month number, a month name, or a month abbreviation.

The program then should return the total number of days in the year up through the given day.

Do take leap years into account.


2.Write a program that creates a structure template with two members according to the following criteria:

a. The first member is a social security number.

The second member is a structure with three members.

Its first member contains a first name, its second member contains a middle name, and its final member contains a last name.

Create and initialize an array of five such structures.

Have the program print the data in this format:

Copy
CSS, HTML. -- 1234567890

Only the initial letter of the middle name is printed, and a period is added.

Neither the initial nor the period should be printed if the middle name member is empty.

Write a function to do the printing; pass the structure array to the function.

b. Modify part a. by passing the structure value instead of the address.



3.Write a program that fits the following recipe:

Externally define a name structure template with two members: a string to hold the first name and a string to hold the second name.

Externally define a student structure template with three members:

a name structure,
a grade array to hold three floating-point scores, and
a variable to hold the average of those three scores.
Have the main() function declare an array of CSIZE (with CSIZE = 4) student structures and initialize the name portions to names of your choice.

Use functions to perform the tasks described in parts d., e., f., and g.

Interactively acquire scores for each student by prompting the user with a student name and a request for scores.

Place the scores in the grade array portion of the appropriate structure.

The required looping can be done in main() or in the function, as you prefer.

Calculate the average score value for each structure and assign it to the proper member.

Print the information in each structure.

Print the class average for each of the numeric structure members.
